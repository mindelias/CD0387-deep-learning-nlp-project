## Model Endpoint Querying Example

Once your model is deployed, you can query it using the following code:

```python
import torch
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

# Load and preprocess image
def preprocess_image(image_path):
    """Preprocess image for model inference"""
    image = Image.open(image_path).convert('RGB')
    
    transform = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.Resize(256),
        transforms.CenterCrop(224),
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize(
            mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], 
            std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        )
    ])
    
    image_tensor = transform(image).unsqueeze(0)
    return image_tensor.numpy()

# Query the endpoint
def predict_dog_breed(predictor, image_path):
    """Send image to endpoint and get prediction"""
    # Preprocess image
    image_array = preprocess_image(image_path)
    
    # Send to endpoint
    response = predictor.predict(image_array)
    
    # Process response
    probabilities = torch.nn.functional.softmax(torch.from_numpy(response), dim=1)
    top5_prob, top5_indices = torch.topk(probabilities, 5)
    
    return top5_indices[0].tolist(), top5_prob[0].tolist()

# Example usage
image_path = "test_image.jpg"
class_ids, confidences = predict_dog_breed(predictor, image_path)

print("Top 5 Predictions:")
for i, (class_id, confidence) in enumerate(zip(class_ids, confidences)):
    print(f"{i+1}. Class {class_id}: {confidence:.4f} ({confidence*100:.2f}%)")
```

### Potential Issues and Solutions

**If you observe anomalous behavior, here are common issues and fixes:**

   - Increase learning rate
   - Use gradient clipping
   - Check data normalization

2. **Exploding Gradients** (gradient norms > 100):
   - Decrease learning rate
   - Implement gradient clipping
   - Reduce model complexity

3. **Overfitting** (training accuracy >> test accuracy):
   - Add dropout layers
   - Increase data augmentation
   - Reduce model complexity
   - Early stopping

4. **Underfitting** (both accuracies plateau low):
   - Increase model complexity
   - Decrease regularization
   - Train for more epochs
   - Check data quality
